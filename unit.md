# A Unified Blockchain-Based Monetary Token (UNIT) Backed by Central Banks

## Background & Motivation

The global financial system stands at a pivotal moment. For decades, fragmented monetary policies, outdated payment infrastructures, and the rapid rise of private digital currencies have exposed deep inefficiencies and inequities in cross-border settlement and access to value. Central banks now face mounting pressure to modernize, collaborate, and offer a sovereign alternative to both volatile cryptocurrencies and the dominance of a single national currency in global trade.

At the same time, the emergence of programmable money, decentralized finance, and digital content economies calls for a new foundation—one that is open, auditable, and adaptable to the needs of both institutions and individuals.

The UNIT project directly addresses these challenges. By uniting the strengths of public blockchains and central bank trust, UNIT aims to deliver a programmable, neutral, and globally accessible digital currency. Through multi-central bank governance, robust privacy, and seamless integration with protocols like CAT, UNIT aspires to become the backbone of a fair, efficient, and future-proof global economy.

## Abstract

UNIT is a decentralized, Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain protocol supporting a unified digital currency initially pegged 1:1 to the US dollar (USD), and gradually governed and co-issued by multiple central banks. The core token, **UNIT**, is designed to provide a globally neutral, transparent, and programmable monetary system for instant cross-border settlement, reduced volatility, and minimized reliance on private stablecoins. By merging the strengths of public blockchains and sovereign monetary policy, UNIT offers a new paradigm for programmable, auditable, and fair global finance.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional fiat currencies operate through national infrastructures, often resulting in inefficiencies, volatility, and reliance on intermediaries. Meanwhile, crypto-assets have demonstrated decentralized settlement but lack sovereign guarantees. UNIT merges these paradigms by introducing a public chain co-governed by central banks with programmable monetary logic, aiming to bridge the gap between trust, transparency, and innovation in the digital era.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Proof-of-Work Blockchain

* Neutral and decentralized consensus.
* High security and resistance to censorship.
* Energy use can be optimized via green mining incentives.

### 2.2 Account-Based Ledger

* Each address maintains a balance in UNIT.
* Supports off-chain signed messages (IOUs) claimable on-chain.

### 2.3 Token Issuance and Pegging

* Initially pegged 1:1 to USD.
* Issued solely by the US Federal Reserve.
* Over time, other central banks (ECB, BOJ, PBOC) join to form a multi-backed token.

### 2.4 Oracle and Governance Layer

* Multisig oracle model: each central bank contributes a signer.
* Smart contracts enforce monetary limits, inflation targets, FX conversion.

## 3. Technical Stack & Chain Model

From a technical perspective, the **UNIT chain** as designed follows a model that is:

---

## More like Ethereum (account-based)

But with a **Bitcoin-style Proof-of-Work (PoW)** consensus mechanism.

Let’s break it down clearly:

## Comparison Overview

| Feature                   | Bitcoin              | Ethereum           | UNIT Chain (Proposed)            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Consensus**             | PoW (Nakamoto)       | PoS (now)          | PoW (Nakamoto-style)             |
| **Ledger model**          | UTXO                 | Account-based      | Account-based                    |
| **Smart contracts**       | No                   | Full EVM           | Selective contracts              |
| **Gas model**             | Fixed tx fees        | Gas + dynamic fees | Fixed or semi-fixed fees in UNIT |
| **Token issuance**        | Block subsidy        | Programmable       | Oracle/CB-authorized minting     |
| **Governance**            | Off-chain (informal) | Minimal            | Multi-CB on-chain governance     |
| **Currency denomination** | BTC                  | ETH + ERC20        | UNIT + FedUSD, ECB_EUR, etc.     |

## Why Account-Based + PoW?

* **PoW** provides political neutrality and decentralization, ideal for international trust across central banks.
* Account-based ledger simplifies:
  * Off-chain signed messages (e.g. IOUs).
  * Balance tracking for multiple fiat-pegged tokens.
  * Cross-currency swaps and FX operations.
* Smart contract layer is minimal by design: only core modules like `MintController`, `BasketManager`, `SignatureVerifier`, and `GovernanceDAO` are required — not general-purpose like Ethereum.

This makes the system:

* Efficient
* Auditable
* Programmable enough, but not bloated or vulnerable to arbitrary dApps.

---

## Inspirations

UNIT chain borrows good elements from:

* **Bitcoin**: for its immutability, PoW decentralization, and ethos of minimal trust.
* **Ethereum**: for its account ledger and smart contract logic (selectively applied).
* **Cosmos/Tendermint**: in governance design (quorum voting).
* **Libra/Diem**: in multi-asset basket modeling (but decentralized and public).

---

## Suggested Stack & Standards

* **Hashing**: SHA-256 (Bitcoin-level)
* **Signatures**: ECDSA / optionally EdDSA (for efficiency)
* **Chain state**: Account mapping with nonce & metadata
* **Contract engine**: WASM or a trimmed-down EVM variant
* **Oracle feed**: Off-chain feeds committed via threshold multisig (like Chainlink but sovereign-run)

## Architecture Overview

```plaintext
[PoW Layer]          -> Public, neutral, secure
[Central Bank Layer] -> Issue/redeem UNIT, maintain policy transparency
[Oracle Layer]       -> Feed FX rates, inflation, reserve ratios
[User Layer]         -> Wallets, banks, dApps interact via APIs and messages
```

## 4. Example Workflows

### 4.1 Initial Issuance (USD Peg)

**Example:** Fed mints 10B UNIT to distribute to U.S. banks.

* Address: `FedReserve.eth`
* Amount: 10,000,000,000 UNIT
* Peg: \$1 = 1 UNIT

### 4.2 Off-Chain Transfer

Alice signs:

```
Transfer 500 UNIT to Bob
Nonce: 42
Signature: [ECDSA by Alice]
```

Bob submits to contract, on-chain transfer executes after verification.

### 4.3 Multi-Currency Phase (Stage 3)

**ECB joins:** issues 1B `ECB_EUR` tokens.

* Users can swap `FedUSD` ↔ `ECB_EUR` via AMM contract at oracle-fed FX rate.

### 4.4 Introduction of UNIT Basket (Stage 4)

```
UNIT Basket Composition:
- 40% FedUSD
- 30% ECB_EUR
- 20% PBOC_CNY
- 10% BOJ_JPY
```

Smart contract dynamically adjusts composition daily based on issued amounts and FX rates.

## 5. Governance and Policy Design

### 5.1 Issuer Eligibility

* Each central bank must verify participation through on-chain identity.
* Quorum voting required to update inflation targets or basket weights.

### 5.2 Emergency Mechanism

* Global freeze or reissuance in case of severe fraud or network compromise.
* Requires 3/4 central bank consensus.

---

## 6. Compliance and Privacy

### 6.1 AML/KYC

* Wallet providers must be licensed and comply with jurisdictional rules.
* Non-custodial wallets allowed with thresholds and disclosures.

### 6.2 Privacy Layer

* Optional ZK layer for transaction obfuscation under legal limits.

## 8.1 Interoperability with Other Protocols and Business Benefits

The UNIT blockchain is designed to interoperate with emerging protocols such as the Content Access Ticket (CAT) Protocol, which enables decentralized, cryptographically signed, and time-limited access to premium digital content. By integrating UNIT with CAT, businesses and creators can seamlessly monetize content, automate royalty flows, and enable frictionless micropayments across media, data, and API services.

Key business benefits include:

* **Seamless Micropayments**: UNIT can be used for instant, low-fee payments for content access, streaming, and digital goods, reducing friction for both users and providers.
* **Cross-Industry Royalty Distribution**: CAT Protocol enables transparent, auditable royalty tracking and distribution, which can be settled in UNIT, supporting creators, publishers, and aggregators.
* **Support for Private Financial Activities**: UNIT's programmable and privacy-enhanced layers allow businesses and individuals to conduct private transactions, manage access rights, and automate compliance while maintaining regulatory standards.
* **Open Ecosystem**: The combination of UNIT and CAT fosters an open, interoperable market for digital value exchange, reducing reliance on siloed platforms and enabling new business models for content, data, and services.

This synergy positions UNIT not only as a global settlement layer for traditional finance, but also as a foundational currency for the digital content economy and private financial activities.

## 9. Stability Mechanisms

### 9.1 Reserve-Backed and Policy-Governed Peg

The stability of UNIT begins with a foundation in sovereign-backed reserves. Initially, UNIT is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and issued solely by the US Federal Reserve, ensuring hard monetary backing. As additional central banks join (e.g., ECB, BOJ, PBOC), each is required to issue only in accordance with verifiable reserves. All issuance and burning actions are governed by policy-enforced smart contracts (MintController), limiting supply changes to approved parameters. This model reduces inflationary risks and enforces disciplined monetary issuance.

### 9.2 Dynamic FX-Oriented Basket Adjustment

To ensure long-term value stability beyond the US dollar, UNIT evolves into a basket-based token reflecting a diversified mix of central bank currencies. The composition is governed by the BasketManager smart contract, which adjusts weights daily based on real-time FX rates and the proportional issuance of each participating central bank. This dynamic adjustment mechanism minimizes exposure to any single currency's volatility and makes UNIT resilient to macroeconomic shifts.

### 9.3 Automated Market-Making for FX Stability

Cross-currency transactions are facilitated through Automated Market Maker (AMM) contracts using real-time FX data from decentralized oracles. These AMMs allow users to swap between UNIT, FedUSD, ECB_EUR, etc., ensuring market-based exchange and liquidity. By embedding FX stabilization into liquidity pools, UNIT mitigates slippage and rate shocks that could undermine its peg.

### 9.4 Transparency, Audits, and Emergency Breakers

All minting, burning, basket rebalancing, and FX updates are transparently recorded on-chain. This allows public and institutional observers to audit UNIT’s backing and behavior in real time. To safeguard against systemic attacks or rapid destabilization, a 3-of-4 central bank quorum can invoke emergency breakers to pause minting, halt certain operations, or reset oracle feeds. These mechanisms ensure the system can react swiftly and responsibly in crisis scenarios while preserving trust and continuity.

---

## 10. Conclusion

A unified digital currency co-issued by central banks on a neutral blockchain would dramatically reshape the global financial system, offering a sovereign alternative to unstable cryptocurrencies and opaque fiat systems. Starting with USD and expanding via governance and collaboration, UNIT can become the foundation of a truly programmable and fair global economy.
