# A Unified Blockchain-Based Monetary Token(UNIT) Backed by Central Banks

## Abstract

We propose a decentralized, Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain that supports a unified digital currency initially pegged 1:1 to the US dollar (USD), and gradually governed and co-issued by multiple central banks. This token, named **UNIT**, aims to provide a globally neutral, transparent, programmable monetary system for instant cross-border settlement, reduced volatility, and minimized reliance on private stablecoins.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional fiat currencies operate through national infrastructures, often resulting in inefficiencies, volatility, and reliance on intermediaries. Meanwhile, crypto-assets have demonstrated decentralized settlement but lack sovereign guarantees. The UNIT project merges these paradigms by introducing a public chain co-governed by central banks with programmable monetary logic.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Proof-of-Work Blockchain

* Neutral and decentralized consensus.
* High security and resistance to censorship.
* Energy use can be optimized via green mining incentives.

### 2.2 Account-Based Ledger

* Each address maintains a balance in UNIT.
* Supports off-chain signed messages (IOUs) claimable on-chain.

### 2.3 Token Issuance and Pegging

* Initially pegged 1:1 to USD.
* Issued solely by the US Federal Reserve.
* Over time, other central banks (ECB, BOJ, PBOC) join to form a multi-backed token.

### 2.4 Oracle and Governance Layer

* Multisig oracle model: each central bank contributes a signer.
* Smart contracts enforce monetary limits, inflation targets, FX conversion.

## 3. Architecture Overview

```plaintext
[PoW Layer]          -> Public, neutral, secure
[Central Bank Layer] -> Issue/redeem UNIT, maintain policy transparency
[Oracle Layer]       -> Feed FX rates, inflation, reserve ratios
[User Layer]         -> Wallets, banks, dApps interact via APIs and messages
```

---

## 4. Example Workflows

### 4.1 Initial Issuance (USD Peg)

**Example:** Fed mints 10B UNIT to distribute to U.S. banks.

* Address: `FedReserve.eth`
* Amount: 10,000,000,000 UNIT
* Peg: \$1 = 1 UNIT

### 4.2 Off-Chain Transfer

Alice signs:

```
Transfer 500 UNIT to Bob
Nonce: 42
Signature: [ECDSA by Alice]
```

Bob submits to contract, on-chain transfer executes after verification.

### 4.3 Multi-Currency Phase (Stage 3)

**ECB joins:** issues 1B `ECB_EUR` tokens.

* Users can swap `FedUSD` ↔ `ECB_EUR` via AMM contract at oracle-fed FX rate.

### 4.4 Introduction of UNIT Basket (Stage 4)

```
UNIT Basket Composition:
- 40% FedUSD
- 30% ECB_EUR
- 20% PBOC_CNY
- 10% BOJ_JPY
```

Smart contract dynamically adjusts composition daily based on issued amounts and FX rates.

## 5. Governance and Policy Design

### 5.1 Issuer Eligibility

* Each central bank must verify participation through on-chain identity.
* Quorum voting required to update inflation targets or basket weights.

### 5.2 Emergency Mechanism

* Global freeze or reissuance in case of severe fraud or network compromise.
* Requires 3/4 central bank consensus.

---

## 6. Compliance and Privacy

### 6.1 AML/KYC

* Wallet providers must be licensed and comply with jurisdictional rules.
* Non-custodial wallets allowed with thresholds and disclosures.

### 6.2 Privacy Layer

* Optional ZK layer for transaction obfuscation under legal limits.

## 7. Roadmap

| Phase | Milestone                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Launch FedUSD chain, single issuer with PoW consensus       |
| 2     | Add signed message transfers and gasless claims             |
| 3     | Interoperability with ECB\_EUR, BOJ\_JPY, PBOC\_CNY         |
| 4     | Create and stabilize UNIT basket token                      |
| 5     | Replace SWIFT and private stablecoins for global settlement |

## 8. Strategic Implications

* Enables global trade without FX inefficiency.
* Reduces dollar hegemony concerns.
* Encourages central bank cooperation.
* Provides programmable, auditable, transparent money.

## 8.1 Interoperability with Other Protocols and Business Benefits

The UNIT blockchain is designed to interoperate with emerging protocols such as the Content Access Ticket (CAT) Protocol, which enables decentralized, cryptographically signed, and time-limited access to premium digital content. By integrating UNIT with CAT, businesses and creators can seamlessly monetize content, automate royalty flows, and enable frictionless micropayments across media, data, and API services.

Key business benefits include:

* **Seamless Micropayments**: UNIT can be used for instant, low-fee payments for content access, streaming, and digital goods, reducing friction for both users and providers.
* **Cross-Industry Royalty Distribution**: CAT Protocol enables transparent, auditable royalty tracking and distribution, which can be settled in UNIT, supporting creators, publishers, and aggregators.
* **Support for Private Financial Activities**: UNIT's programmable and privacy-enhanced layers allow businesses and individuals to conduct private transactions, manage access rights, and automate compliance while maintaining regulatory standards.
* **Open Ecosystem**: The combination of UNIT and CAT fosters an open, interoperable market for digital value exchange, reducing reliance on siloed platforms and enabling new business models for content, data, and services.

This synergy positions UNIT not only as a global settlement layer for traditional finance, but also as a foundational currency for the digital content economy and private financial activities.

## 9. Conclusion

A unified digital currency co-issued by central banks on a neutral blockchain would dramatically reshape the global financial system, offering a sovereign alternative to unstable cryptocurrencies and opaque fiat systems. Starting with USD and expanding via governance and collaboration, UNIT can become the foundation of a truly programmable and fair global economy.

## 10. Stability Mechanisms

### 10.1 Reserve-Backed and Policy-Governed Peg

The stability of UNIT begins with a foundation in sovereign-backed reserves. Initially, UNIT is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and issued solely by the US Federal Reserve, ensuring hard monetary backing. As additional central banks join (e.g., ECB, BOJ, PBOC), each is required to issue only in accordance with verifiable reserves. All issuance and burning actions are governed by policy-enforced smart contracts (MintController), limiting supply changes to approved parameters. This model reduces inflationary risks and enforces disciplined monetary issuance.

### 10.2 Dynamic FX-Oriented Basket Adjustment

To ensure long-term value stability beyond the US dollar, UNIT evolves into a basket-based token reflecting a diversified mix of central bank currencies. The composition is governed by the BasketManager smart contract, which adjusts weights daily based on real-time FX rates and the proportional issuance of each participating central bank. This dynamic adjustment mechanism minimizes exposure to any single currency's volatility and makes UNIT resilient to macroeconomic shifts.

### 10.3 Automated Market-Making for FX Stability

Cross-currency transactions are facilitated through Automated Market Maker (AMM) contracts using real-time FX data from decentralized oracles. These AMMs allow users to swap between UNIT, FedUSD, ECB_EUR, etc., ensuring market-based exchange and liquidity. By embedding FX stabilization into liquidity pools, UNIT mitigates slippage and rate shocks that could undermine its peg.

### 10.4 Transparency, Audits, and Emergency Breakers

All minting, burning, basket rebalancing, and FX updates are transparently recorded on-chain. This allows public and institutional observers to audit UNIT’s backing and behavior in real time. To safeguard against systemic attacks or rapid destabilization, a 3-of-4 central bank quorum can invoke emergency breakers to pause minting, halt certain operations, or reset oracle feeds. These mechanisms ensure the system can react swiftly and responsibly in crisis scenarios while preserving trust and continuity.
